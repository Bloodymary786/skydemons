            A fighter aircraft, often referred to simply as a fighter, is a military fixed-wing aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft. The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed
            and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The fighter's main tactical purpose is to establish air superiority over the battlefield.<br><br> The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges
            on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters. Many fighters have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and
            some types, such as fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, these include the interceptor, heavy fighter, and night fighter.
